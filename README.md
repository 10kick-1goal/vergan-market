## Note: Some features are still on progress, this project is still a beta version üôÇ

- I used Ruby on Rails as the backend to build the database and to create a REST API along with implementing other features.
- I used ReactJS to fetch and render the data.
- I used React-Redux as a state management tool.
- I used React-Router to create single page application and smooth navigation.
- I used GSAP to create animation.
